Adds a rule for precatcher.
Usage: <cmd> sitename netname channelname botnicks (PRE|COMPLETE|MP3|PRETIME) words [section]
botnicks is a comma separated list of nicks of the bot.
All the rest parameters are optional, you can use - to skip a parameter.
event can be PRE, COMPLETE or - (omitted), which is the default.
Keyword DONE and COMPLETE and READY are not needed to add for COMPLETE event.
words is a comma separated list of words which are in the line of the actual event.
If you specify section, section is forced to be that one.
Examples:
site X1 uses the default dZsbot theme, so we need to specify the botname only:
<cmd> X1 LINKNET #x1 x1bot
In case the nickname x1bot is taken, the sitebot is using x1b0t, which means you can add as 2nd rule as well:
<cmd> X1 LINKNET #x1 x1b0t
or you can merge the two into this single rule:
<cmd> X1 LINKNET #x1 x1bot,x1b0t

Ok, lets say we have a site called X2, which has its mp3 section in a separated channel, and the bot doesnt announce word MP3 in the lines.
Since its still using the default dZsbot theme, so complete and pre events can be recognized without additional info, all we do is forcing
the channel to MP3 section:
<cmd> X2 LINKNET #x2 x2bot - - MP3

Ok, we have a site called X3, they are very expert guys and customized the theme, so they annonce complete as cumshot and pre as squirt.
Lets add its rules:
<cmd> X3 LINKNET #x3 x3bot COMPLETE cumshot
<cmd> X3 LINKNET #x3 x3bot PRE squirt
without these rules the precatcher would recognize all the events as newdirs.

Ok, lets say X4 has an additional bot next to the sitebot, which announces the pretime.
<cmd> X4 LINKNET #x4 nonamebot PRETIME
